One of the thigns that I appreciate about this assignment is that it is important to commit changes OFTEN! And I also appreciate that you it talked about how to resolve conflicts. I have worked in the industy with people that have been working for years at a company and they still struggle to know how to resolve conflicts that come when merging data.

### Startup Assignment Takeaways
#### William Pendleton Learned:
In creating the design for the Excursions website, I have learned the importance of user experience and design in web development. I began by researching existing travel planning websites and looking at their design elements and layouts. This helped me to understand what works well in terms of user navigation and functionality.

Throughout the design process, I learned about the importance of visual hierarchy, color theory, and typography in creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly website. I also learned about the importance of responsive design, ensuring that the website looks and works well on various devices and screen sizes.

Additionally, I have learned the importance of user testing and getting feedback from potential users to ensure that the design meets their needs and expectations. This is essential for creating a successful web application.

Overall, the design process has been a valuable learning experience and has provided me with a deeper understanding of the principles of web design and user experience.

Paint.net (a piece of opensource freeware) is not the most powerful image editing tool, especially for graphical design. Brainstorming the visual aspects of a website or project is an intensive process.

## Amazon Web Services -EC2
#### William Pendleton Learned
In this assignment, I set up a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance and prepared it with an elastic IP address. This process allowed me to learn about the importance of using cloud-based infrastructure in web development and the benefits of using a service like AWS.

The process of creating a new AWS instance is relatively straightforward. I logged into the AWS Management Console, selected the EC2 service, and followed the prompts to create a new instance. Once the instance was created, I was able to ssh into it to make sure that everything was set up correctly.

I then associated an Elastic IP address with the instance, which allows for a static, public IP address that can be used to access the instance from anywhere. This is important for ensuring that the server is accessible to users and can be used to host a website or web application.

Overall, this assignment has provided me with a deeper understanding of the benefits and considerations of using cloud-based infrastructure in web development and the importance of security in these environments.

*Elastic IP address: 3.130.135.1*
