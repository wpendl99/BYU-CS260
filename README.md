### Startup Assignment Takeaways
#### William Pendleton Learned:
In creating the design for the Excursions website, I have learned the importance of user experience and design in web development. I began by researching existing travel planning websites and looking at their design elements and layouts. This helped me to understand what works well in terms of user navigation and functionality.

Throughout the design process, I learned about the importance of visual hierarchy, color theory, and typography in creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly website. I also learned about the importance of responsive design, ensuring that the website looks and works well on various devices and screen sizes.

Additionally, I have learned the importance of user testing and getting feedback from potential users to ensure that the design meets their needs and expectations. This is essential for creating a successful web application.

Overall, the design process has been a valuable learning experience and has provided me with a deeper understanding of the principles of web design and user experience.

#### Daniel Yu Learned:
Paint.net (a piece of opensource freeware) is not the most powerful image editing tool, especially for graphical design. Brainstorming the visual aspects of a website or project is an intensive process.
