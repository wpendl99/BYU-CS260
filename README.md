### Startup Assignment Takeaways

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In creating the design for the Excursions website, I have learned the importance of user experience and design in web development. I began by researching existing travel planning websites and looking at their design elements and layouts. This helped me to understand what works well in terms of user navigation and functionality.

Throughout the design process, I learned about the importance of visual hierarchy, color theory, and typography in creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly website. I also learned about the importance of responsive design, ensuring that the website looks and works well on various devices and screen sizes.

Additionally, I have learned the importance of user testing and getting feedback from potential users to ensure that the design meets their needs and expectations. This is essential for creating a successful web application.

Overall, the design process has been a valuable learning experience and has provided me with a deeper understanding of the principles of web design and user experience.

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

Paint.net (a piece of opensource freeware) is not the most powerful image editing tool, especially for graphical design. Brainstorming the visual aspects of a website or project is an intensive process.

<a id='aws-ec2'></a>

## Amazon Web Services - EC2

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In this assignment, I set up a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance and prepared it with an elastic IP address. This process allowed me to learn about the importance of using cloud-based infrastructure in web development and the benefits of using a service like AWS.

The process of creating a new AWS instance is relatively straightforward. I logged into the AWS Management Console, selected the EC2 service, and followed the prompts to create a new instance. Once the instance was created, I was able to ssh into it to make sure that everything was set up correctly.

I then associated an Elastic IP address with the instance, which allows for a static, public IP address that can be used to access the instance from anywhere. This is important for ensuring that the server is accessible to users and can be used to host a website or web application.

Overall, this assignment has provided me with a deeper understanding of the benefits and considerations of using cloud-based infrastructure in web development and the importance of security in these environments.

_Elastic IP address: 3.130.135.1_

</details>

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

Accessing a remote server remotely continues to be 'fun'. I always think its pretty cool to be able to access services and run programs on other machines other than the one I am sitting directly infront of. Between this, the BYU CS department lab machines, the servers I occasionally work on for work at BYU, and my own personal RunPod instances for beefy GPUs, I continue to learn more and have a blast.

Obviously, inconsistent IP addresses that are allocated as machines become active pose a problem. Even leaving an instance online 24/7 is unneccesarry and dangerous. This is why elastic IPs offer such an advantage, creating a continuous reference to your dynamic instances that remains under your name.

_Elastic IP address: 3.136.241.90_

<a id='aws-r53'></a>

## Amazon Web Services - Route53

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In this part of the assignment, I used the AWS browser console to log in and then used Route 53 to purchase a domain name. The domain name that I purchased is worldexcusions.click.

Route 53 is a service provided by AWS that allows users to manage their DNS records. This includes purchasing domain names, creating and managing DNS records, and monitoring the health of their domain.

After purchasing the domain name, I set up my DNS records using Route 53. This included creating a record representing my root domain name (worldexcusions.click) and a wildcard subdomain ((LiteralyAnything).worldexcusions.click). This allows for any subdomain to be used with the root domain, making it more flexible for the users.

I then tested that I could access my server using my domain name and any subdomain name. This confirmed that the DNS records were set up correctly and that my server is accessible using the domain name.

This part of the assignment has provided me with a deeper understanding of the process of purchasing and setting up a domain name and how to use Route 53 to manage DNS records. It also showed me how to test that the server is accessible using the domain name and any subdomain name.

Overall, this assignment has helped me to understand the importance of having a domain name and how to set it up and manage it properly.

_Domain: [http://worldexcursions.click](http://worldexcursions.click)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

Following the steps described in the documentation from Github posed no issues and I was able to purchase my domain name and get my own instance with relative ease. I know that AWS serves as the backbone to a lot of internet services and companies and so this first interaction is very informative and engaging.

Looking at the available domain names was fun and made me have to choose between cost and appearances. I was happy to secure a domain ending in .world, which feels pretty cool and relevant to our prospective start up project.

_Domain: [http://excursionsxr.world](http://excursionsxr.world)_

<a id='https'></a>

## HTTPS, TLS and web certificates

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In this part of the assignment, I learned about HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol for secure communication over the internet. It is the preferred method of communication for sensitive information, such as online transactions or the exchange of personal information. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the cryptographic protocol that is used to secure the data being transmitted over the internet.

The project was set up with Caddy, a web server that automatically requests and generates certificates from Let's Encrypt for all of the domains and subdomains of the website. This is a great advantage because it eliminates the need for manual certificate management, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

In the past, I have had to set up servers and request certificates, and I know how much of a hassle it can be to make sure that the certificate covers all of the subdomains and switch between the development environment, which doesn't use HTTPS, to a production environment, which does. With Caddy and Let's Encrypt, the process is made much easier and more streamlined.

This part of the assignment has helped me to understand the importance of using HTTPS and TLS for secure communication and how Caddy and Let's Encrypt make the process of setting up certificates much easier and more efficient. Overall, this assignment has been a great learning experience and has provided me with a deeper understanding of the role of web certificates in secure communication.

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

Caddy is a nice solution for handling the aquisition of SSL certificates. In my workplace, we have to renew certificates from DigiCert every year or every other year, and it's quite a few more steps getting the certificates installed and placed. I'm wondering if Caddy can be configured to be used on our servers as well, but probably not, considering we don't use the more open and free solution.

It's nice to have chrome no longer freak out when connecting to my domain. The TLS system is a different and interesting approach to handling the security problem that comes with being online. It, in combination with RSA encryption, likely are the backbone for modern information exchange.

<a id='html-introduction'></a>

## HTML Introduction

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In this assignment, we were introduced to HTML and its elements, tags, attributes and hyperlinks. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It uses a set of tags to structure the content and tell the browser how to display it.

To demonstrate my understanding of HTML, I created a simple personal portfolio webpage. The webpage consisted of a header, an introduction section, an about me section, a section for my links and a footer.

In the header, I included the title of the webpage, "Hello world, This is me!". In the introduction section, I talked about myself and what I do. In the about me section, I listed out some of my skills and provided a brief description for each of them using unordered lists. In the links section, I included some important links. Finally, in the footer, I put a little not saying thank you.

By creating this simple HTML page, I learned how to use various HTML elements and tags to structure and display content on a webpage.

_Codepen Link: [Hello world](https://codepen.io/wpendl99/pen/vYabemq)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

This section was just a quick introduction to HTML and getting familiar with the conventions. Tags play a key role in forming the structure of webpages and also allowing webcrawling systems like search engines to catalogue and understand the content of your site.

[Back to top](#top)
<a id='html-structure'></a>

## HTML Structure

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In this assignment, I learned about HTML structure elements and their distinction between block and inline elements. The purpose of HTML is to provide structure and content to web applications, and common HTML structural elements include body, header, footer, main, section, aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, and span. Proper representation of the page structure using these elements is important for logical sense and for automated tools like search indexing crawlers and accessibility screen readers to correctly interpret the document. Block elements are meant to be distinct blocks in the flow of content, while inline elements are meant to be inline with the content flow of block elements. For example, a div block element could have an inline b element to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text, while a p element could have a span to mark the sub-text as a person's name.

_Codepen Link: [Sample Website Layout](https://codepen.io/wpendl99/pen/zYLepJw)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

Tags became more important here, as things like "reader mode" for iOS or MacOS take advantage of tags to determine the content of your page. There's many tools that exist for us to use to build our website, from top to bottom.

[Back to top](#top)
<a id='html-input'></a>

## HTML Input

#### William Pendleton Learned:

HTML inputs allow for user input on a website or web application. There are several types of inputs, including text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-down menus, and submit buttons. HTML inputs are essential for collecting data from users, and they play a crucial role in web development.

One interesting aspect of HTML inputs is the versatility they offer in terms of data collection. Different input types cater to specific data requirements, and developers can choose the type that best fits their needs. For instance, a drop-down menu is ideal for offering a limited number of choices, while a text input allows for free-form data entry.

_Codepen Link: [Form for Ordering Ice Cream](https://codepen.io/wpendl99/pen/BaPMYjy)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

While it may not play a key role in what we do (as we will learn to use JS to perform a lot of these interactible tasks), forns served as the basis for user interaction with webpages and sending data back to webservers. While not present in the fork, and as something that may have to be implemented in JS, we need to perform clear and explicit error descriptions to prevent friction with users on our site.

[Back to top](#top)
<a id='html-media'></a>

## HTML Media

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In this lesson on HTML media elements, I learned about various ways to include multimedia in a web page. The main media elements are img, audio, video, svg, and canvas. The img, audio, and video elements are used to reference external media, while the svg and canvas elements allow for creation of graphics directly within HTML.

I found the use of the svg and canvas elements to be particularly interesting. The svg element allows for powerful and flexible graphics rendering within HTML, and can be animated using JavaScript and CSS. The canvas element also enables 2D drawing and animation, but requires JavaScript support. The possibilities for visualizations with these elements are virtually endless, making them a valuable tool for web developers.

Overall, I learned about the different options for adding media to a web page and the benefits and limitations of each.

_Codepen Link: [A Tour of Africa](https://codepen.io/wpendl99/pen/ZEjwrav)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

Embedding both internal dynamic and external content is key to providing any other media other than text. I'm curious about how involved embedding dynamic content from an external source is, and if you are the one providing the external content, how you need to build your website and webserver to correctly and seamlessly integrate with other people's uses of your content. People embed YouTube viewers, which don't present video media with the same player as everything else, so I wonder how that is done and what the source site can see about its content's use on other platforms or sites.

<a id='html-website'></a>

## HTML Website

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In this assignment, the task was to create a personal HTML website and deploy it on out server. The process involved verifying that the server is running, forking and cloning a repository containing the required files, personalizing the HTML template, replacing an image, and deploying the website using a shell script. The script utilized the secure copy (scp) command to transfer files to the server's public_html directory where the web server looks for static pages to host. We then verified the website was successfully deployed by accessing it through a browser.

What I found interesting about this assignment was the utilization of a shell script to deploy the website. It demonstrated how automation can make the process of deploying a website much easier and more efficient. Additionally, having a personal website as a portfolio to showcase projects and assignments completed in the class can be a valuable asset for demonstrating skills and knowledge to others.

<a id='simon-html'></a>

## Simon HTML

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In this assignment, I demonstrated my ability to use basic HTML elements such as structure, formatting, input, output, links, and drawing to build a Simon game application. The application has a login page, game play page, high scores page, and about page, each with a header for navigation and a footer that references the source repository.

To complete this assignment, I:

- Reviewed the code for the example Simon HTML application
- Cloned the repository to my development environment
- Created my own version of the Simon application, focusing on understanding the concepts from the example project
- Set the footer link to point to my own code repository
- Committed and pushed my code to my repository multiple times as I hit milestones
- Deployed my code to my production environment using the deployFiles.sh script
- Updated my startup repository README.md to reflect on what I learned
- Submitted the URL of my production environment for grading.

Through this assignment, I learned how to:

- Create multiple HTML pages connected with hyperlinks
- Properly use HTML structural elements, header elements, and doctype
- Use Git to commit and push code to a repository
- Deploy code to a production environment using a script

I am now more confident in my ability to build basic HTML applications and manage their code using Git and deployment scripts.

<a id='css-practice'></a>

## CSS Practice

#### William Pendleton Learned:

The HTML and CSS code I provided demonstrated several fundamental concepts and techniques I recently learned in web development, such as:

- Selectors: CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. In the example I provided, various selectors were used to target different elements, such as the nav element, the ul element, and the a element.
- Declarations: CSS declarations are used to define the styles to be applied to the targeted elements. Declarations consist of a property and a value, such as color: #fff or font-size: 16px.
- Layout: The CSS box model and layout techniques were used to control the position and size of the elements on the page. The display property was used to specify whether elements should be block-level or inline, and the position property was used to control the positioning of elements.
- Responsive design & Animation: The @media rule was used to define styles that apply only when the screen size is below a certain width, allowing the page to be responsive to different screen sizes and the :hover selector enabled it to be animated while the user was using the website.

<a id='css-flex'></a>

## CSS Flex

#### William Pendleton Learned:

The process of creating a fully responsive application using media queries was a really interesting and eye-opening experience. One of the things that stood out to me the most was how much control I had over the design and layout of my application for different screen sizes. By using media queries to adjust the styles and positioning of various elements, I was able to ensure that my application looked great and functioned properly on a wide range of devices, from smartphones to large desktop monitors.

Another thing I found fascinating was how the use of media queries allowed me to create a consistent and cohesive user experience across all devices. By tailoring the design to fit the unique constraints of each screen size, I was able to make sure that the content was easily accessible and readable no matter what device a user was accessing it from. This not only improved the usability and accessibility of my application, but it also helped to establish trust and credibility with my users, who could rely on a consistent and reliable experience no matter where they were accessing my application from. Overall, I found the process of building a fully responsive application with media queries to be a challenging but highly rewarding experience, and one that has given me a greater appreciation for the importance of designing with a mobile-first mindset.

<a id='css-frameworks'></a>

## CSS Frameworks

#### William Pendleton Learned:

During my assignment on Bootstrap, I had the opportunity to experiment with different Bootstrap components such as badges, breadcrumbs, buttons, and dropdowns, and I found this to be a lot of fun. These components are essential UI elements that can enhance the user experience of a website, and it was great to see that I took the time to explore how they work within the Bootstrap framework.

In addition, I found the Tailwind CSS Framework to be cool, which indicates my interest in exploring different CSS frameworks. By experimenting with different frameworks and exploring various components, I am taking important steps towards becoming a more skilled and versatile developer.

Overall, the process of building a simple home page with Bootstrap was an engaging and enjoyable experience for me, and it's exciting to see that I have a passion for learning about different frameworks and exploring various components to create a better user experience for websites.

<a id='simon-css'></a>

## Simon CSS

#### William Pendleton Learned:

By incorporating CSS and Bootstrap into my Simon game, I was able to create a visually appealing and responsive design that improved the overall look and feel of the application, making it more user-friendly. I also gained experience with structuring CSS files, modifying code, and experimenting with changes to see their effects. Although bootstrap has been fun to learn, I'm excited to explore other frameworks like Tailwind CSS and think that my startup project would be a great way to work on implementing those frameworks. This assignment helped me to better understand how to use CSS and Bootstrap to enhance the design and user experience of a web application, and I'm looking forward to continuing to build on this knowledge in future projects.

_Website Link: [Simon CSS (wkp23)](https://simon.worldexcursions.click/archive/v2)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

CSS allows for significantly greater levels of flexibility and depth in terms of visual elements, styling, and more in webpages. Interactivity and dynamic elements are still lacking, but this takes buttons from buttons to shapes and resizeable composition. HTML and CSS go hand in hand in creating the content of a website, with CSS just as vital.

[Back to top](#top)
<a id='startup-html-css'></a>

## Startup HTML & CSS

#### William Pendleton Learned:

One interesting thing about HTML is its versatility and ability to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Through the use of different HTML elements and attributes, we can structure the content of a web page and create a variety of different styles and layouts. Additionally, HTML provides a foundation for other web development technologies such as CSS and JavaScript, allowing for even more creativity and functionality.

_Website Link: [WorldExcursions.click](https://start.worldexcursions.click/)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

We added custom styles for the header section, including a gradient background color and a larger font size for the site title. We also modified the styles for the navigation bar to have a different background color and hover effect when the links are hovered over. Additionally, we added a custom font to the site using the @font-face rule.

In terms of what I learned using CSS, I discovered how to use selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. I also learned about box model properties such as padding and margin, as well as how to use CSS to create responsive layouts that adjust to different screen sizes.

<a id='ux-design'></a>

## UX Design

#### William Pendleton Learned:

I designed to do my assignemnt on airbnb's website.

One of the things that people tend to appreciate about Airbnb's UX design is how intuitive and easy it is to use. The homepage has a clear call to action that prompts users to begin searching for accommodations, and the search results page is well-organized and easy to navigate. The use of high-quality photos and a clean, uncluttered design also helps to create a positive user experience.

In addition, Airbnb's UX design is highly effective at providing relevant information to users. For example, the search results page shows important details about each listing, such as price, location, and reviews from previous guests. This makes it easy for users to quickly evaluate whether a particular listing is a good fit for their needs.

Overall, Airbnb's UX design is a great example of how to create a user-friendly and visually appealing web interface that effectively meets the needs of its users.

_Website Link: [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

I really like the white theming behind this website which sets other elements out such as gameplay clips and images as visually striking. The website is also far from basic, and the white theme is hand in hand with the clean design language of the Quest 2 headset itself. It is as if the website is meant to reflect the headset, and your experience within it which will be clean with gameplay and other experiences as the standouts.

<a id='js-TOCL'></a>

## JavaScript Types, Operators, Conditionals, and Loops

#### William Pendleton Learned:

I found it interesting how the for loop and conditional statement work together to generate a random password of the user's desired length, while also ensuring that the user input is valid. The use of Math.random() and Math.floor() to select a random index from the allowed characters is also a clever technique that simplifies the code for generating random strings.

_Website Link: [Random Password Generator](https://codepen.io/wpendl99/pen/bGxeNPj)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

While experimenting with conditionals and loops in JavaScript, I learned how to use if-else statements and the ternary operator to execute code conditionally. I also learned how to use loops, including for, while, do-while, for-in, and for-of loops, to iterate over arrays and objects. Additionally, I gained experience using break and continue statements to control loop execution.

<a id='js-functions'></a>

## JavaScript Functions

#### William Pendleton Learned:

I found it interesting how this assignment combines various types of functions in JavaScript, including standard, inner, and anonymous functions. The use of an inner function to update the count display adds an extra layer of encapsulation, which makes the code more modular and easier to maintain. The anonymous function that adds event listeners to the buttons also demonstrates how JavaScript allows functions to be used as values and passed around as arguments, which is a powerful feature of the language. Overall, this assignment provides a good example of how to use different types of functions to create a responsive and modular web application.

_Website Link: [Counting with JS](https://codepen.io/wpendl99/pen/MWqjvrX)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

I learned about inner functions which are functions declared inside other functions that allow for modularizing code without exposing private details. This helped to simplify the code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.
By passing parameters and returning values from functions, I was able to create a more dynamic and customizable program. This allowed for greater flexibility in the code and made it easier to reuse specific blocks of code.

<a id='js-arrow-functions'></a>

## JavaScript Arrow Functions

#### William Pendleton Learned:

Something interesting thing about this assignment is that it demonstrates how the arrow function syntax can be used to create compact and readable code for event listeners. Instead of defining a named function and passing it as a parameter to the addEventListener method, we can define an arrow function inline with the addEventListener method call. This helps to reduce clutter and make the code more concise. Additionally, because arrow functions inherit the this pointer from the surrounding scope, we don't need to use bind or call to maintain the correct value of this inside the function body.

_Website Link: [To-Do List](https://codepen.io/wpendl99/pen/MWqjvGX)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

I learned that arrow functions in JavaScript can be more concise than standard function syntax and have special rules for the return keyword. They also inherit the this pointer from their creation scope, which can be useful for closures.

<a id='js-arrays'></a>

## JavaScript Arrays

#### William Pendleton Learned:

One aspect that stood out to me while I was doing this assignment was how when you combine several of the array methods you are able to manipulate JavaScript arrays in many ways, and I used it to create a simple but useful Grocery List application. For example, the tasks array is used to store the list of tasks, while the renderTasks() function uses the forEach() method to iterate over the tasks array and create a new DOM element for each task, with a "Delete" button that uses the splice() method to remove the task from the tasks array. Additionally, the addTask() function uses the push() method to add new tasks to the tasks array, and the input and addBtn elements are used to handle user input and trigger the addTask() function. All in all, this assignment demonstrates how powerful and versatile arrays and object functions can be in building interactive web applications.

_Website Link: [Grocery List 2.0](https://codepen.io/wpendl99/pen/ExegvOJ)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

I learned that JavaScript arrays represent a sequence of objects and primitives that can be referenced using a zero-based index. I also learned about several useful static functions associated with the Array object, such as map, reduce, sort, and filter. These functions allow me to manipulate and work with arrays in a variety of ways, making it easier to write efficient and effective JavaScript code.

<a id='js-objects-classes'></a>

## JavaScript Objects and Classes

#### William Pendleton Learned:

One interesting aspect of this assignment that I implement into my example was the use of object constructors, and I used it to create Book objects in a CodePen that creates a table of My Favorite Books. Using object constructors allows us to create multiple Book objects with similar properties and methods without having to write repetitive code. This is a useful concept to understand because it helps to simplify our code and make it more efficient. Additionally, it allows us to work with complex data structures that can be easily updated and maintained.

<a id='js-destructuring'></a>

## JavaScript Destructuring

#### William Pendleton Learned:

One thing that I find interesting about destructuring in JavaScript is how it allows us to easily extract and assign values from arrays and objects.

With array destructuring, we can assign individual values from an array to separate variables in a single line of code. This can help make our code more concise and readable, especially when working with large arrays.

Object destructuring allows us to extract values from objects and assign them to variables with the same name as the object's properties. We can also use object destructuring to extract values from nested objects and rename variables to avoid naming conflicts.

Destructuring can also be used to provide default values for variables in case a value is undefined or null. This can help prevent errors and improve the robustness of our code.

_Website Link: [Array and Object Destructuring Example](https://codepen.io/wpendl99/pen/oNPZoNb)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

In this project, I learned that array destructuring allows me to extract individual elements from an array and assign them to variables in a simpler and more efficient way.

## Simon JavaScript

#### William Pendleton Learned:

I just finished an assignment for my Simon can web app that added three new JavaScript files, and I have to say, it was a really cool experience. One of the files helped me implement a player login system that stores usernames in local storage, which was super helpful for keeping track of who's playing. The second file was the heart of the game itself, with button and game classes that controlled the gameplay and made everything work smoothly. Finally, the third file was responsible for reading local storage scores and displaying them on a table, which was a really neat way to keep track of progress and encourage players to keep trying to beat their high scores.

Overall, I really enjoyed working on this assignment and seeing how all the different pieces of JavaScript fit together to create a functional game. I learned a lot about how to structure my code and how to make use of local storage to store and retrieve important data. I also appreciated how the professor broke down the different aspects of the game into separate files, which made it much easier to understand and work with. All in all, I feel like I came away from this assignment with a much better understanding of JavaScript and how to use it to build cool things like this Simon can game.

_Website Link: [Simon JS (wkp23)](https://simon.worldexcursions.click)_

#### Daniel Yu Learned:

JavaScript was added to provide functionality such as login, game play interactions, and score display. login.js file stores the user's name in local storage and redirects the browser to the play.html page. scores.js file retrieves high scores from local storage and injects them into the DOM. The play.js file includes Button and Game classes to handle button interactions and manage the game sequence. Now, the Simon game becomes fully functional and interactive, allowing users to play, save scores, and compete with others.

<a id='ws-express'></a>

## Express

#### William Pendleton Learned:

One interesting aspect of the lesson is the implementation and use of middleware functions in Express. Middleware functions are an essential part of an Express application, as they provide modular functionality and allow developers to manage the flow of request and response data more effectively. They can be used for various purposes, such as routing, authentication, CORS, sessions, serving static web files, cookies, and logging.

Middleware functions have a similar structure to routing functions, with the primary difference being that routing functions are only called if the associated pattern matches, while middleware functions are called for every HTTP request unless a preceding middleware function does not call the 'next' function. This demonstrates how middleware functions can control the order of execution and the flow of data through an Express application.

The lesson demonstrates the use of built-in, third-party, and custom middleware functions. The built-in middleware function, 'express.static', serves static files from a specified directory. The third-party middleware function, 'cookie-parser', simplifies cookie generation and access. The custom middleware function is created to log the URL of each request.

This concept of middleware functions in Express shows how developers can easily add, remove, or modify features in their application by simply chaining or rearranging middleware functions. It highlights the flexibility and modularity of the Express framework, making it a powerful tool for building web applications.

## React Components

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In this assignment, I learned about the core concepts of React components, which help modularize application functionality, promote code reuse, and facilitate user interaction. Key features of React components include render functions for generating the user interface, properties for receiving and displaying information, and internal state management using the React.useState hook function.

I modified the CodePen demo so that now it accepts an initial background color property and maintains its internal state for foreground and background colors, as well as an "outlook" message. The component uses event handlers to change the background and foreground color on mouse hover and toggle the outlook message, showcasing React's capabilities in creating dynamic, interactive user interfaces with properties, state management, and reactivity.

<a id='react-reactivity'></a>

## React Reactivity

#### William Pendleton Learned:

This assignment focuses on React's architectural foundations that enable reactivity through component properties (props), state, and render functions. The example given contains two components, a parent Survey component and a child Question component. The Survey component has a color state, which is passed to the Question component as a property. This ensures that any changes in Survey's color state will be reflected in the Question component, demonstrating how parent components can control a child component's functionality.

The Question component has its own answer state, which is displayed within the component's content and can be interacted with by the user through HTML radio input elements. When the input is changed, the Question component's onChange function is called, and the answer state is updated accordingly. This automatically updates the displayed answer, illustrating React's reactivity in response to user input or data changes. Note that state updates are asynchronous, so you should not assume the state will be updated immediately after calling the updateState function.

## React Tic-Tac-Toe

#### William Pendleton Learned:

In the "Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe" from React, I learned the basics of building a functional tic-tac-toe game using React components, state management, and event handling. The tutorial provided a step-by-step guide to creating the necessary components for the game, such as the Board and Square components. I found it particularly interesting how state management was handled, with state being lifted up from the Square component to the Board component. This allowed for easier management of the game's state and facilitated the implementation of the game's logic. 

Another interesting aspect of the tutorial was the use of immutability for updating the state of the game. By creating a new copy of the squares array instead of modifying it directly, it helped maintain a clear history of the game's state, making it easier to implement features like undo and redo. This also demonstrated the benefits of immutability in React applications, which can lead to better performance and easier debugging. Overall, the tutorial provided a solid foundation for understanding the core concepts of React and offered valuable insights into best practices for building interactive applications.

The React CLI assignment provided a comprehensive introduction to using the create-react-app Command Line Interface (CLI) to set up a React-based project. I learned how to use NPX to run create-react-app, which generates a fully configured template for a React application. This template includes necessary files, components, and NPM packages that make it easy to get started with building a React application. The assignment also illustrated how the generated project structure can be modified to suit specific needs, such as removing testing and performance monitoring packages, or adjusting file extensions to better differentiate between JSX and JS files.

One interesting aspect of the assignment was the exploration of how the development and production builds are created using the npm start and npm run build commands. These commands transpile, minify, and inject the proper JavaScript into the application, resulting in an optimized production build. Additionally, I found the discussion on the difference between using .js and .jsx file extensions for React components informative, as it highlighted how certain tools might behave differently based on the chosen extension.
